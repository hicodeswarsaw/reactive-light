<b>Reactive Light</b>


Here you can find out how to buil proximity light reactive module.
You can combine as many modules as you wish, possibilities are endless!


<b> How does it work? </b>

Technology behind is based on analogue circuit - so this time there is no coding only pure electronics.
Human motion is detected by infrared light, when something passes signal operational amplifier LM324 changes voltage that light up the LED diode.

<b>You will need</b>

- Operational Amplifier LM 324 ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-Genuine-ST-STM-LM324N-LM324-Low-Power-Quad-Op-Amp-Opamp-SHIPS-FROM-USA-/331685802762?hash=item4d3a03b30a:g:t7MAAOSwx-9Wxiue )
- DC adapter ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-5V-12V-2A-AC-Adapter-Power-Supply-Transformer-for-5050-5630-3528-Strip-F6-/292023702855?var=&hash=item43fdf81547:m:mzaQpN4BK_qkuDAxILrp0Kg )
- Set of resisotrs (depened what DC adapter you wan to use, for 5V use 100 Ohm , for 12 V use 650 Ohm) 
- IR led light diodes ( 8 for each module ) ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/100pcs-5mm-IR-LED-Diodes-Water-Clear-Infrared-940nm-Blub-Transparent-Lamp-USA-/122516464013?hash=item1c868ce18d:g:QikAAOSwr7ZW4RX2 )
- Led light diodes ( you can use from 1 to 4 pieces for each module, depeneds on your project) ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/10colors-1000pcs-5mm-Led-Diodes-Water-Clear-Red-Green-Blue-Yellow-White-Mix-Kits/201225507487?_trksid=p2045573.c100508.m3226&_trkparms=aid%3D555014%26algo%3DPL.DEFAULT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D41376%26meid%3Ddbd3ed53b17e40259e284f4409efe771%26pid%3D100508%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26 )
- Tin & Soldering Iron ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/63-37-0-8mm-Tin-Lead-Rosin-Core-Solder-Flux-Soldering-Welding-Iron-Wire-Reel-New-/221441371043?hash=item338eef2ba3:g:WggAAOxyZzlTdWxh

- Wires ( http://www.ebay.com/itm/0-25mm-Wire-Wrapping-Wire-30AWG-Cable-305m-New-Blue-ED-/121939560546?hash=item1c642a0862:g:5MAAAOSw2xRYQEaY )
- Soldering prototype board (for my purpose I used designed board, you can find patch design also in this repositorium) 

<b> Solder all items as shown on the circuit diagram</b>

As I mentioned beofre, this time no coding.
So all you need is solder all parts as shown on the circuit.

<b> Rememeber </b>

If you choose 12 V circuit remember to check twice if your Led Light Diodes also operate on this voltage! 
Otherwise you will burn them all :)
